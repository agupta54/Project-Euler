In this case, $(A + C + B) - (B + C + A) = 0$, which is always divisible by $11$. Hence, our proposition is correct.  "

    "**Some Bounds:** For a $6$-digit number, in the interval of $100000$ (this is not the smallest interval); we ought to find a palindrome. The problem here is that the palindrome should be a multiple of $2$ numbers which have $3$-digits each. Since, factoring a number is a difficult problem, hence we take the other route. We start looking from $900*900 = 810000$ to $999*999 = 998001$. As the palindrome is divisible by $11$ by *Proposition $1$*, we will start from $902*900$ till $990*999$. We can improve a bit more as the last digit of the palindrome can't be $0$, so, we can start from $902*901$ and end our search at $979*999$. The first counter will be just the multiples of $11$.   "
